```TS
enum StructureLinkDistance {
    None = "NONE",
    Min = "MIN",
    Max = "MAX"
}
```

This `enum` is used for the Structure Matching functionality to indicate the distance constraint between two entries in the structure definition visible in the [[StructureTable]]. The user can toggle this constraint for any two entries by clicking on the icon between them.
