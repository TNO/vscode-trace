### Open Documentation
Good documentation allows feedback from readers so they can point out inconsistencies or typos and have them addressed quickly. Even better is providing a feedback loop where those readers can see that their issue has been noted and track progress and see how it fits into the rest of the work to be done. Better still is a place where readers can jump in and submit their own edits if they feel inclined.
